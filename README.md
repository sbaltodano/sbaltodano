## Welcome To My Github Profile!
Hello and welcome! I am happy and proud to share my Github profile and projects with you. I am passionate in my pursuit of a new career in the field of data science or business analytics and these projects are just the beginning of my journey. In the past few years I have explored real estate and marketing professions, but these roles left a lot to be desired in my life. I could not find passion in my work or fervor in my conviction until I was introduced to the power of data and the importance of metrics while helping a friend grow their startup, [Alta Eagle Group](https://altaeaglegroup.com/). I began building dashboards, creating and managing KPIs, and sourcing data... at which point it was clear to me that this was the most interesting and inspiring work I had done in years. I molted my shell and gleefully (some say stupidly) lept into this new career, beginning with FlatIron School. I am grateful for the experiences and knowledge FlatIron School, my instructors, and my cohort-mates has given me and I have never been more sure that I made the right decision. So, sit back, relax, and get to know me through my projects. Thank you for reading!
